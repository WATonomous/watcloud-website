title: 'Under the Hood: What is WATcloud?'
description: "Curious about how WATcloud makes computing resources easily and fairly accessible to everyone? Join us as we kick off a blog series exploring our four-year journey of refining our compute cluster's hardware and software—from servers and networking to user provisioning and observability systems."

    Image generated using DALL-E with ChatGPT-assisted prompt: "A comic-style drawing of a person standing in front of a larger car with a red hood, looking under the hood and finding it filled with computer parts instead of an engine. The car should have no engine visible; instead, the hood reveals computer parts like circuit boards, CPUs, cooling fans, and cables. The person is smaller in size compared to the car, standing on the ground, and looks surprised, with wide eyes and a raised eyebrow. The scene is light-hearted and humorous, with vibrant colors and exaggerated expressions, capturing the surprise and confusion of the person."

WATcloud's mission is to make computing resources easily and fairly accessible to everyone.
Over the past four years, we have continuously refined both the hardware and software that comprise our cluster.
On the hardware side, WATcloud includes servers, switches, IP-KVMs[^ip-kvm], and other peripherals that form our compute infrastructure.
On the software side, we have developed a variety of systems for managing the compute cluster, user provisioning, and auxiliary services.
These efforts encompass over 3,000 pull requests and tickets in our internal monorepo, along with more than 40 satellite repositories—ranging
from bug-fixing forks of open-source projects to custom tools.
Throughout the years, we've learned and grown immensely, and we're excited to share our journey with you.

[^ip-kvm]: IP-KVM stands for Internet Protocol Keyboard, Video, and Mouse. It allows us to remotely control servers (console access, power cycling, etc.) as if we were physically present.

Over the next few blog posts, we'll be sharing the architecture of WATcloud in its current state and how we got here.
Here's a list of topics we'll be covering:
- Compute cluster hardware setup
- Operating system, hypervisor, and virtual machine configuration
- Distributed storage configuration
- Network configuration
- Compute cluster provisioning pipeline
- User provisioning pipeline
- Resource management systems
- Observability systems
- On-prem and cloud-based Kubernetes clusters (and automatic failover)
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) configuration
- DNS management
- Email infrastructure
- Website/blog infrastructure
- Auxiliary services (Discord, GitHub, Google Workspace, etc.)
- Current major projects

This list may be adjusted as we publish more posts, and we'll make sure to hyperlink each item as we go.
