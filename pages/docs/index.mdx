Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## Who We Are
We are **WATcloud**, a dedicated division of [WATonomous](https://watonomous.ca/). Our expertise is in building and managing cloud infrastructure, serving both WATonomous and various student initiatives at the University of Waterloo.

## Our Offerings
- **Compute Cluster**: We provide Linux virtual machines equipped with a good amount of compute, memory, storage, networking, and GPU resources. Backing our infrastructure is a 10 Gbps link to [UWaterloo's ISPs](https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/about/organizational-structure/technology-integrated-services-tis/network-services-resources/external-connections) ([network map](https://ns-info.uwaterloo.ca/netstats/core.php)) and a cluster network with 10/40Gbps links between computers. Integrated with tools like Docker, a distributed filesystem (Ceph), and Network-Attached Storage (NAS), our Linux virtual machines cater to diverse project requirements. Please refer to our [inventory](/machines) for more information.
- **Platform Management**: We manage collaboration and communication platforms such as GitHub, Google Workspace, and Discord for WATonomous.

{/* TODO: list the number of student teams we help, the number of FYDP groups, and the total number of users. */}
