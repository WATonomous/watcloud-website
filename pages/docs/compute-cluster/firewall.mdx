# Firewall

<Callout type="warning">
On 2024-12-18, the university requested that we move bastion to behind the firewall due to general security concerns.
This means that users without access to the UWaterloo campus or VPN will no longer be able to access the cluster.
We are working with the university to find a solution to this problem.
