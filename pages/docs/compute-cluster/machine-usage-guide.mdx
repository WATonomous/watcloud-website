# Machine Usage Guide

This document provides an overview of the machines in the WATcloud compute cluster, including their hardware, networking, operating system, services, and software.
It also includes guidelines for using the machines, troubleshooting instructions for common issues, and information about maintenance and outages.

## Types of Machines

There are two main types of machines in the cluster: [general-use machines](/machines#general-use-machines) and [SLURM compute nodes](/machines#slurm-compute-nodes).
We will refer to them both as "development machines" in this document.

### General-Use Machines

General-use machines are meant for interactive use and are shared among all users in the cluster.
Additionally, general-use machines marked as SLURM login nodes (`SL`) in the [machine list](/machines#general-use-machines)
can be used to submit jobs to the [SLURM cluster](./slurm).

Instructions for accessing our general-use machines can be found in our [SSH documentation](./ssh).

### SLURM Compute Nodes

Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open-source job scheduler that allocates resources to jobs on a cluster of computers.
It is widely used in HPC[^hpc] environments to provide a fair and efficient way to run jobs on a shared cluster.

Instructions for accessing our SLURM cluster can be found in our [SLURM documentation](./slurm).

[^hpc]: [High-performance computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) (HPC) is the use of supercomputers and parallel processing
  techniques to solve complex computational problems. Examples of HPC clusters include [Cedar](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Cedar) and
  [Graham](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Graham).

## Hardware

Most machines in the cluster come with standard workstation hardware that include CPU, RAM, GPU, and storage[^machine-specs]. In special
cases, you can request to have specialized hardware such as FPGAs installed in the machines.

[^machine-specs]: Machine specs can be found [here](/machines).

## Networking

All machines in the cluster are connected to both the university network (using 10Gbps or 1Gbps Ethernet)
and a cluster network (using 40Gbps or 10Gbps Ethernet). The IP address range for the university network is
`129.97.0.0/16`[^uwaterloo-ip-range] and the IP address range for the cluster network is `10.0.50.0/24`.

[^uwaterloo-ip-range]: The IP range for the university network can be found [here](https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/about/organizational-structure/technology-integrated-services-tis/network-services-resources/ip-requests-and-registrations).

## Operating System

All development machines are virtual machines (VMs)[^hypervisor].
This setup allows us to easily manage machines remotely and reduce the complexity of the bare-metal OSes.

[^hypervisor]: We use [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) as our hypervisor.

## Services

### `/home` Directory

We run an SSD-backed Ceph[^ceph] cluster to provide distributed storage for machines in the cluster.
All development machines share a common `/home` directory that is backed by the Ceph cluster.

Due to the relatively expensive cost of SSDs and observations that large file transfers can slow down the filesystem for all users,
the home directory should only be used for storing small files.
If you need to store large files (e.g. datasets, videos, ML model checkpoints), please use one of the other storage options below.

[^ceph]: [Ceph](https://ceph.io/) is a distributed storage system that provides high performance and reliability.

### `/mnt/wato-drive*` Directory

We have a few HDD-backed NFS[^nfs] servers that provide large storage for machines in the cluster.
These NASes are mounted on all development machines at the `/mnt/wato-drive*` directories.
You can use these mounts to store large files such as datasets and ML model checkpoints.

[^nfs]: [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) stands for "Network File System" and is used to share files over a network.

### `/mnt/scratch` Directory

Every general-use machine has an SSD-backed local storage pool that is mounted at the `/mnt/scratch` directory.
These storage pools are meant for temporary storage for jobs that require fast and reliable filesystem access,
such as storing training data and model checkpoints for ML workloads.

The space on `/mnt/scratch` is limited and shared between all users.
Please make sure to clean up your files frequently (after every job).
To promote good hygiene, there is an aggressive soft quota on the `/mnt/scratch` directory.
Please refer to the [Quotas](./quotas) page for more information.

Scratch space is available on SLURM compute nodes as well.
They are mounted at `/tmp` and can be requested using the [`tmpdisk` resource](./slurm#grestmpdisk).

### Docker

Every development machine has Docker Rootless[^docker-rootless] installed.
On general-use machines, the Docker daemon is automatically started[^docker-systemd] when you log in.
On SLURM compute nodes, the Docker daemon needs to be [started manually](./slurm#using-docker).

On general-use machines, the storage location for Docker is set to `/var/lib/cluster/users/$UID/docker`, where `$UID` is your user ID.
`/var/lib/cluster` is an SSD-backed storage pool, and there is a per-user storage quota to ensure that everyone has
enough space to run their workloads. Please refer to the [Quotas](./quotas) page for more information.

[^docker-rootless]: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform for neatly packaging software, both for development and deployment.
  [Docker Rootless](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) is a way to run Docker without root privileges.

[^docker-systemd]: The Docker daemon is started using a systemd user service.

### S3-compatible Object storage

We have an S3-compatible object storage that runs on the Ceph cluster. If you require this functionality, please contact a WATcloud
admin to get access.

### Kubernetes

We run a Kubernetes cluster using [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/). This is mostly for running internal WATcloud services. However,
if you require this functionality, please contact a WATcloud admin to get access.

### GitHub Actions Runners

We run a GitHub Runner farm on Kubernetes using [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller).
Currently, it's enabled for the WATonomous organization. If you require this functionality, please reach out to a WATcloud admin to get access.

## Software

We try to keep the machines lean and generally refrain from installing software that make sense for rootless installation or running in
containerized environments.

Examples of software that we install:
- Docker (rootless)
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- zsh
- various CLI tools (e.g. `vifm`, `iperf`, `moreutils`, `jq`, `ncdu`)

Examples of software that we do not install:
- conda (use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) instead)
- ROS (use [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/ros) instead)
- CUDA (use [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda) instead. Or use [CVMFS](./slurm#cvmfs) on the SLURM compute nodes.)

If there is a piece of software that you think should be installed on the machines, please reach out to a WATcloud team member.

## Maintenance and Outages

We try to keep machines in the cluster up and running at all times. However, we need to perform regular maintenance to keep machines
up-to-date and services running smoothly. All scheduled maintenance will be announced in
[infrastructure-support discussions](https://github.com/WATonomous/infrastructure-support/discussions)[^maintenance-notify].
Emergency maintenance and maintenance that has little effect on user experience will be announced in the `#🌩-watcloud-use` channel on Discord.

[^maintenance-notify]: The GitHub team `@WATonomous/watcloud-compute-cluster-users` will be notified.  Please ensure that you
[enable notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications)
to receive these notices.

Sometimes, machines in the cluster may go down unexpectedly due to hardware failures or power outages.
We have a comprehensive suite of healthchecks and internal monitoring tools[^watcloud-observability] to detect these failures and notify us.
However, due to the part-time nature of the student team, we may not be able to respond to these failures immediately.
If you notice that a machine is down, please ping the WATcloud team on Discord
(`@WATcloud` or `@WATcloud Leads`, in the `#🌩-watcloud-use` channel).

[^watcloud-observability]: Please refer to the [Observability](/docs/community-docs/watcloud/observability) page to learn more about the tools we use to monitor the cluster.

To see if a machine is having issues, please visit [status.watonomous.ca](https://status.watonomous.ca). The WATcloud team uses this page as
a dashboard to monitor the health of machines in the cluster.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use [SLURM](./slurm) as much as possible. SLURM streamlines resource allocation. You get a dedicated environment for your job, and you don't have to worry about CPU/memory contention.
- Be [nice](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/nice.2.html)
  - If you have a long-running non-interactive process on a general-use machine, please [increase its niceness](https://www.tecmint.com/set-linux-process-priority-using-nice-and-renice-commands/) so that interactive programs don't lag.
  - Being nice is simply changing `./my_program arg1 arg2{:bash}` to `nice ./my_program arg1 arg2{:bash}`.
- Clean up after yourself
  - If you are using `/mnt/scratch` on a general-use machine, please make sure to clean up your files after you are done with them.
  - Please only use `/home` for small files. Writing large files to `/home` will significantly slow down the filesystem for all users.
  - `/mnt/wato-drive*` are large storage pools, but they are not infinite and can fill up quickly with today's large datasets.
    Please remove unneeded files from these directories.
  - When using Docker on general-use machines, please clean up your Docker images and containers regularly. `docker system prune --all{:bash}` is your friend.

## Troubleshooting

This section contains some common issues that users may encounter when using machines in the cluster and their solutions. If you encounter an issue that is not listed here, please [reach out](./support-resources).

### Account not available

You may see the following message when trying to log into a general-use machine:

> This account is currently not available.

This message means that your account is locked.
This can happen if your account is expired and is pending deletion.
To re-enable your account, please reach out to your [WATcloud contact](/docs/services#watcloud-contact).

### Permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon

You may encounter this error when trying to run Docker commands on general-use machines:

```
> docker ps
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

This error occurs when your shell doesn't source `/etc/profile` (`zsh` is known to do this). Our Docker rootless setup
requires that the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable be set properly, which is done in `/etc/profile`. To fix this,
please add the following line to your shell's rc file (e.g. `~/.zshrc`):

```bash copy
export DOCKER_HOST=unix://${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/docker.sock
```

Remember to restart your shell or source the rc file after making the change.

### Disk quota exceeded when running Docker commands

You may encounter the following error when running Docker commands on general-use machines:

```
> docker pull hello-world
...
open /var/lib/cluster/users/$UID/docker/tmp/GetImageBlob3112047691: disk quota exceeded
```

This means that you have exceeded your allocated storage quota[^quota-more-info].
Here are some commands you can use to free up disk space[^docker-prune]:

```bash
# remove dangling images (images without tags)
docker image prune
# remove all images without an existing container
docker image prune --all
# remove stopped containers
docker container prune
# remove all volumes not used by at least one container
docker volume prune
# remove all stopped containers, dangling images, unused networks, and unused build cache
docker system prune
# same as above, but also removes unused volumes
docker system prune --volumes
# same as above, but also removes unused images
docker system prune --volumes --all
```

[^docker-prune]: For more information about the Docker prune commands, please refer to the [Docker manual](https://docs.docker.com/config/pruning/)
[^quota-more-info]: For more information about storage quotas, including how to check your current quota usage, please see the [Quotas](./quotas) page.


### Cannot connect to the Docker daemon

You may encounter this error when trying to run Docker commands on general-use machines:

```
> docker ps
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///run/user/$UID/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

To troubleshoot this issue, please run the following command to confirm whether the Docker daemon is running:

```bash copy
systemctl --user status docker-rootless
```

A healthy Docker daemon should look like this:

```ansi

If the daemon failed to start, the output may look like this:

```ansi

```

To get more information about why the daemon failed to start, you can view the logs by running:

```bash copy
journalctl --user --catalog --pager-end --unit docker-rootless.service
```

One of the most common reasons for the Docker daemon to fail to start is that the storage quota has been exceeded. If this is the case, you will see `disk quota exceeded` in the logs:

```

For more information about storage quotas, please see the [Quotas](./quotas) page.

To free up space for Docker, you can selectively delete files from the `/var/lib/cluster/users/$(id -u)/docker` directory until you are no longer over quota. However, it could be difficult to determine which files to delete. If you would like to delete all your Docker files (including images, containers, volumes, etc.), which effectively resets your Docker installation, you can delete the entire directory:

```bash copy
rootlesskit rm -r /var/lib/cluster/users/$(id -u)/docker
```

Here, `rootlesskit{:bash}` puts us in the "fake root" environment used by Docker rootless[^rootlesskit], which allows us to manage files owned by subuid/subgid.

[^rootlesskit]: Learn more about rootlesskit [here](https://github.com/rootless-containers/rootlesskit).

If you would prefer to use Docker tools to clean up your Docker installation (e.g. `docker system prune --all{:bash}`), you can reach out to a WATcloud team member to temporarily increase your storage quota so that Docker daemon can be started.

Once you have freed up enough space, you can restart the Docker daemon by running:

```bash copy
systemctl --user restart docker-rootless
```
