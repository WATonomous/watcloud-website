# Getting Access to the Compute Cluster

<Steps>
### Determine your WATcloud contact

Every compute cluster user must have a WATcloud contact. Your WATcloud contact is responsible for approving your access request and helping
you with any issues you may have with the compute cluster.

If you are a member of a group in the following categories, your WATcloud contact is your group lead:
- [WUSA clubs](https://wusa.ca/clubs/)
- [SSDC teams](https://uwaterloo.ca/sedra-student-design-centre/directory-teams)
- UWaterloo research groups
- [UWaterloo capstone design teams](https://uwaterloo.ca/capstone-design/)

If you are the lead of a group and would like to request access for your group, please email infra-outreach@watonomous.ca.

### Fill out the onboarding form
 
Please fill out the [Onboarding form](https://cloud.watonomous.ca/docs/utilities/onboarding-form) and make sure to enable the "Compute Cluster" option.
 
### Get approval from your WATcloud contact

Reach out to your WATcloud contact and ask them to approve your request. Your WATcloud contact is trained to help you with this process.

### Wait for your access to be provisioned

After your request is approved, it usually takes about 15 minutes for your access to be provisioned. Your WATcloud contact has visibility
into the provisioning process and can work with the WATcloud team to resolve any technical issues that may arise.

Once your access is provisioned, you will receive a welcome email.
