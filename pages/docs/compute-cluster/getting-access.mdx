### Determine your WATcloud contact

To access the compute cluster, you must be affiliated with WATcloud. You may already be affiliated through the following groups:

#### UWaterloo student clubs and design teams

If you are affiliated with a registered UWaterloo student club or design team (e.g. a [WUSA Club](https://wusa.ca/clubs/), an [SSDC team](https://uwaterloo.ca/sedra-student-design-centre/directory-teams), etc.),
you are automatically eligible for compute cluster access for the purpose of running workloads for your group. Your WATcloud contact is your group lead.

If you are a group lead and would like to request access for your group, please email infra-outreach@watonomous.ca with your intended use case and a list of members who require access.

#### UWaterloo research groups

If you are a research group member and would like to request access for your research group, 
please email infra-outreach@watonomous.ca with your research project and a list of 
members who require access.

#### UWaterloo student projects

If you require access for a UWaterloo student project (e.g. a [Capstone Design project](https://uwaterloo.ca/capstone-design/)), please email infra-outreach@watonomous.ca with a description of your project and your intended use case.
