import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Steps>
### Determine your WATcloud contact

Your [WATcloud contact](/docs/services#watcloud-contact) will be your primary point of contact for onboarding and support.

### Fill out the onboarding form
 
Please fill out the [onboarding form](/docs/utilities/onboarding-form) and make sure to enable the "Compute Cluster" option.
 
### Get approval from your WATcloud contact

Reach out to your WATcloud contact and ask them to approve your request.

### Wait for your access to be provisioned

After your request is approved, it usually takes about 15 minutes for your access to be provisioned. Your WATcloud contact has visibility
into the provisioning pipeline and can work with the WATcloud team to resolve any technical issues that may arise.

Once your access is provisioned, you will receive a welcome email.

### Read the user manual

Please read the [user manual](./user-manual) to get a high-level overview of the compute cluster.

### SSH into the cluster

Once your access is provisioned, you can SSH into the cluster using the instructions on the [SSH](./ssh) page.

### Running your first job

Once you have SSHed into the cluster, you can run your first job using the instructions on the [SLURM](./slurm) page.
