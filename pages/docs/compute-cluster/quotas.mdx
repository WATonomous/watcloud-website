# Quotas

To ensure that everyone has a fair share of resources, we enforce a set of quotas in the cluster.

## Disk quotas

### Default disk quotas

This section lists the default per-user disk quotas. These quotas are subject to change as we learn more about the usage patterns.

#### Global disk quotas

Global disk quotas are quotas on filesystems that are shared across all nodes.

### Checking your disk quota

The method for checking your disk quota depends on the filesystem type (`FS Type`).
The filesystem type is listed in the [default disk quotas](#default-disk-quotas) section.
This section describes how to check your disk quota for each filesystem type.

#### `ceph`

To check your disk quota, run the following command:

```bash copy
getfattr -n ceph.quota "<path>"
```

For example, to check the disk quota for your home directory, run the following command:

```bash copy
getfattr -n ceph.quota "$HOME"
```

In the output below, the user `ben` has a quota of 20 GiB and unlimited (represented by `0`) files in their home directory.

```
# file: home/ben
ceph.quota="max_bytes=21474836480 max_files=0"
```

To check your current usage, run the following commands:

```bash copy
getfattr -n ceph.dir.rbytes "<path>"
getfattr -n ceph.dir.rfiles "<path>"
```

For example, to check the current usage of your home directory, run the following commands:

```bash copy
getfattr -n ceph.dir.rbytes "$HOME"
getfattr -n ceph.dir.rfiles "$HOME"
```

In the output below, the user `ben` has used 16.8 GiB of space across 210,104 files in their home directory.

```
# file: home/ben
ceph.dir.rbytes="18056911629"

# file: home/ben
ceph.dir.rfiles="210104"
```

### Requesting a disk quota increase

If you find that you regularly exceed your quotas, you can request for a quota increase by specifying your
desired quota in your profile and have your WATcloud contact[^watcloud-contact] approve it. You can edit your
profile using the [Profile Editor](../utilities/profile-editor).

[^watcloud-contact]: Your WATcloud contact is the person as described in the [Getting Access](./getting-access#determine-your-watcloud-contact) section.

## CPU and memory quotas

On login nodes, per-user CPU and memory quotas are enforced to prevent resource starvation:

Unlike disk quotas, we don't allow users to request CPU and memory quota increases. Please use [SLURM](./slurm) to run resource-intensive jobs.
