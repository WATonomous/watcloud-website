# Quotas

To ensure that everyone has a fair share of resources, we enforce a set of quotas in the cluster.

## Terminology

- **Hard limit**: The limit that cannot be exceeded. If the hard limit for a disk quota is reached,
    the user will receive a "disk quota exceeded" error when trying to write to the disk.
- **Soft limit**: The limit that can be temporarily exceeded. We set the grace period to 7 days[^7-day-grace].
    If the soft limit is reached for more than 7 days, the user will receive a "disk quota exceeded"
    error when trying to write to the disk.

[^7-day-grace]: The 7-day grace period is the default on most Linux quota implementations.

## Disk quotas

### Default disk quotas

This section lists the default per-user disk quotas. These quotas are subject to change as we learn more about the usage patterns.

#### Global disk quotas

Global disk quotas are quotas on filesystems that are shared across all nodes.

<GlobalQuotaTable className="mt-4" />

#### Node-local disk quotas

Node-local disk quotas are quotas on filesystems that are local to each node.

<NodeLocalQuotaTable className="mt-4" />

### Checking your disk quota

The method for checking your disk quota depends on the filesystem type (`FS Type`).
The filesystem type is listed in the [default disk quotas](#default-disk-quotas) section.
This section describes how to check your disk quota for each filesystem type.

#### `ceph`

To check your disk quota, run the following command:

```bash copy
getfattr -n ceph.quota "<path>"
```

For example, to check the disk quota for your home directory, run the following command:

```bash copy
getfattr -n ceph.quota "$HOME"
```

In the output below, the user `ben` has a quota of 20 GiB and unlimited (represented by `0`) files in their home directory.

```
# file: home/ben
ceph.quota="max_bytes=21474836480 max_files=0"
```

To check your current usage, run the following commands:

```bash copy
getfattr -n ceph.dir.rbytes "<path>"
getfattr -n ceph.dir.rfiles "<path>"
```

For example, to check the current usage of your home directory, run the following commands:

```bash copy
getfattr -n ceph.dir.rbytes "$HOME"
getfattr -n ceph.dir.rfiles "$HOME"
```

In the output below, the user `ben` has used 16.8 GiB of space across 210,104 files in their home directory.

```
# file: home/ben
ceph.dir.rbytes="18056911629"

# file: home/ben
ceph.dir.rfiles="210104"
```

#### `xfs`

To check your disk quota, run the following command[^quota-command]:

 [^quota-command]: `quota` is a command-line utility that is available on most Linux installations with quota support. 
 
 {/* You can learn more about the
    command [here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/quota) or by running `man quota`*/}

```bash copy
quota --human-readable=g,
```

For example, in the output below, the user `ben` has a soft limit of 30 GiB and a hard limit of 50 GiB on `/dev/sdc`, and has used 1 GiB of space.

```bash
> quota --human-readable=g,
Disk quotas for user ben (uid 1507):
     Filesystem   space   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
       /dev/sdc      1G     30G    50G              51       0       0
```

to find out which mountpoint corresponds to `/dev/sdc`, run the following command:

```bash
> df -h /dev/sdc
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdc        200G   34G  167G  17% /var/lib/cluster
```

In this case, `/dev/sdc` is mounted on `/var/lib/cluster`. This drive is used to store docker-related data,
as shown in the [Default disk quotas](#default-disk-quotas) section.

### Requesting a disk quota increase

If you find that you regularly exceed your quotas, you can request for a quota increase by specifying your
desired quota in your profile and have your WATcloud contact[^watcloud-contact] approve it. You can edit your
profile using the [Profile Editor](../utilities/profile-editor).

[^watcloud-contact]: Your WATcloud contact is the person as described in the [Getting Access](./getting-access#determine-your-watcloud-contact) section.

## CPU and memory quotas

On general-use machines, per-user CPU and memory quotas are enforced to ensure fair resource sharing.

<CPURAMQuotaTable className="mt-4" />

Unlike disk quotas, we don't allow users to request CPU and memory quota increases. Please use [SLURM](./slurm) to run resource-intensive jobs.
