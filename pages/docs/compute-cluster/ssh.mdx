# SSH

Now that you have access to the WATcloud compute cluster (Don't have access yet? Make a request [here](./getting-access)),
you can use [SSH](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/) to connect to the cluster.

The general syntax for connecting to the cluster is:

```bash copy
SSH_KEY_PATH="<path_to_ssh_key>"
SSH_USERNAME="<username>"
SSH_HOST="<hostname>"
ssh -v -i "$SSH_KEY_PATH" "$SSH_USERNAME@$SSH_HOST"
```

or if you are using a jump host:

```bash copy
SSH_KEY_PATH="<path_to_ssh_key>"
SSH_USERNAME="<username>"
SSH_HOST="<hostname>"
SSH_JUMP_HOST="<jump_host>"
ssh -v -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -i \"$SSH_KEY_PATH\" \"$SSH_USERNAME@$SSH_JUMP_HOST\"" -i "$SSH_KEY_PATH" "$SSH_USERNAME@$SSH_HOST"
```

## Command Generator

Here's a tool to help you generate a personalized SSH command. This tool will generate a command that you can copy and paste into your terminal.

The generated command does *not* require setting up [ssh agent](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/agent) or [ssh config](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/config/).
However, you may soon find that setting them up will make your life easier. If you are interested in learning more about these
tools, please check out the official documentation linked above and use your [search-fu](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=search-fu)
to find more resources.
