# Services

WATcloud offers a variety of services. This page provides an overview of the services available.

## General Access instructions

Access to most[^access-otherwise] services listed below can be requested via the [onboarding form](/docs/utilities/onboarding-form).
Requests will be reviewed by your group's WATcloud contact.

[^access-otherwise]: If a service requires a different access process, it will be mentioned in the service description.

### WATcloud contact

A WATcloud contact is the designated representative for each group—typically the group lead—responsible for approving access requests and supporting users during onboarding.

The following groups are currently registered with WATcloud:

import { affiliationInfo } from '@/lib/data'
import { AffiliationList } from '@/components/affiliation-list'

<AffiliationList affiliationInfo={affiliationInfo} />

If your group isn't listed or appears as [Legacy][^legacy-affiliation], please ask your group lead to [register the group][registered-affiliations] with WATcloud.

If your group is already registered, contact your group lead to find out who your WATcloud contact is.

[registered-affiliations]: /docs/registered-affiliations
[^legacy-affiliation]: A legacy affiliation is a group that was onboarded before the current [registered affiliations][registered-affiliations] system was in place. Members of legacy affiliations can still access the compute cluster, but in order to use newer features like [SLURM](/docs/compute-cluster/slurm), the group must be registered.
