## History

When WATcloud first opened up access to non-WATonomous groups, we asked group leads to provide and maintain a list of their members who required access to WATcloud services. We then assigned a WATcloud member to each group to act as a liaison and approve access requests. This approach worked reasonably well initially, but as the number of groups increased, it became challenging to keep track of group memberships and the individuals responsible for approving access requests. Additionally, we received requests from groups seeking greater visibility into the provisioning process so that they could resolve issues (e.g., incorrect GitHub usernames) themselves.

To address these challenges, we created a new system for managing access to WATcloud services, which we call "Registered Affiliations." The system provides access to and trains a few members from each group to manage WATcloud services for their group. They become the point of contact for their members and have visibility into the provisioning process. This new approach allows us to scale up the number of groups with minimal overhead.
