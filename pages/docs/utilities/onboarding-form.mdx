# Onboarding Form

Use the form below to request access to WATcloud services.
Editing an existing profile? Please use the [profile editor](./profile-editor) to request
for a pre-populated form.

Please select the services that you need access to and fill out the required information.
If you were not told which services to request, please clarify with your WATcloud contact[^watocloud-contact].
Requesting access to services that you do
not need will slow down the approval process.

If your changes are trivial[^trivial-changes], your pull request will be automatically merged and will not require approval.


[^watocloud-contact]: Your WATcloud contact is usually your group lead.
    See [Getting Access](/docs/compute-cluster/getting-access) for more information.
	
[^trivial-changes]: Examples of trivial changes are changes that only involve active terms or compute cluster public keys.
