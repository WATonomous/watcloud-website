# Platfom Usage

Below are some tutorials on how to get set up with the various platforms
used by WATonomous (or WATO for short)!

## Discord

Our Discord server can be found [here](https://discord.gg/gsP7XNds6p)!
Hope to see you there soon.

### Discord Roles

Fill out the "WATonomous Discord" section of the WATO 
[onboarding form](https://cloud.watonomous.ca/onboarding-form/). If your 
submission is approved, you will get your roles in our Discord server!

## GitHub

GitHub is where we keep WATO's code!

### WATonomous GitHub Organization

If you are a new WATO member, please fill out the "GitHub" section of the WATO 
[onboarding form](https://cloud.watonomous.ca/onboarding-form/) to receive an 
invite to the WATO Github organization!

## Google Workspace

Newly accepted WATO **core members**
should create a Google Workspace account under `watonomous.ca`. You will get 
your own `watonomous.ca` email address as well as access to some team resources!

### Creating an Account

To create a WATO Google Workspace account, fill out the "Google Workspace" section 
of the WATO [onboarding form](https://cloud.watonomous.ca/onboarding-form/). After 
the form submission is approved, please **use the "Forgot password?" button** on 
the [login page](https://accounts.google.com/) to have a password reset 
link sent to your recovery email. Set your account password through the link, and 
you should be good to go!

### Joining Google Groups

If you are a recently accepted WATO **core member**, please join the `WATonomous Team` 
Google Group in the WATO [onboarding form](https://cloud.watonomous.ca/onboarding-form/), 
under `Google Workspace > Email > Google Groups`. This will grant you access 
to the shared WATO team Google Drive.
