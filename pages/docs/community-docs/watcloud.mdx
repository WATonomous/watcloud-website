# WATcloud Team Documentation

## Overview

As a WATcloud member, you have access to a variety of resources to help you get started and be successful.

First, you should get familiar with all of the [services](/docs/services) that WATcloud provides.
Using these services regularly (e.g. run your homework assignments and personal projects on the [compute cluster](/docs/compute-cluster))
will help you understand them from a user's perspective[^dogfooding].

[^dogfooding]: There's a term for this: [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).

Next, you should understand the [WATcloud Guidelines](./watcloud/guidelines).
These guidelines are a set of best practices that help produce high-quality work and facilitate collaboration.

Finally, you should obtain access to various tools that the team uses.
You can do this through the [onboarding-form](/docs/utilities/onboarding-form).
Here's a list of the most important ones:
- Discord: Our primary communication platform. Select the `WATcloud` role, and `Incoming Member` if you are new, or `Core Member` after you've polished and deployed your first WATcloud project.
- GitHub: Our primary code repository. Select `WATonomous Team` to get access to internal repos.
- Compute Cluster: Our primary compute resource.
- WATcloud Internal Tools: A collection of internal tools (e.g. Prometheus) that you may find useful.
- Sentry: Our error tracking tool. Select `WATcloud Team` to get access to WATcloud projects.
- Additional Comments: Let us know if you're interested in onboarding using an [internal project](/get-involved/join#internal-tickets-and-hardware-projects) or anything else you think the team should be aware of.

As you get more involved in the team, you may need to access additional tools or upgrade your access level.
A team lead will help you with this.

## Meetings

import websiteConfig from '@/build/fixtures/website-config.json'
import { Link } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

WATcloud hosts weekly meetings every **Wednesday at 9:00 PM Eastern Time**. These meetings take place on <Link href={`https://discord.gg/${websiteConfig.discord_invite_code}`}>Discord</Link> in the `General 1` voice channel. Sometimes, we may also have meetings in-person in the server room (`CPH-3667`) to perform hardware maintenance.

Each meeting is an opportunity to review ongoing projects, plan upcoming work, and discuss technical or administrative topics.

WATcloud members are expected to attend the meetings, and anyone else is welcome to join as well.
