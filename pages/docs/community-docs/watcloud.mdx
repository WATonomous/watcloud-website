# WATcloud Team Documentation

## Overview

As a WATcloud member, you have access to a variety of resources to help you get started and be successful.

First, you should get familiar with all of the [services](/docs/services) that WATcloud provides.
Using these services regularly (e.g. run your homework assignments and personal projects on the [compute cluster](/docs/compute-cluster))
will help you understand them from a user's perspective[^dogfooding].

[^dogfooding]: There's a term for this: [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).

Next, you should understand the [WATcloud Guidelines](./watcloud/guidelines).
These guidelines are a set of best practices that help produce high-quality work and facilitate collaboration.

Finally, you should obtain access to various tools that the team uses.
You can do this through the [onboarding-form](/docs/utilities/onboarding-form).
Here's a list of the most important ones:
- Discord: Our primary communication platform. Select the `WATcloud` role, and `Incoming Member` if you are new, or `Core Member` after you've polished and deployed your first WATcloud project.
- GitHub: Our primary code repository. Select `WATonomous Team` to get access to internal repos.
- Compute Cluster: Our primary compute resource.
- WATcloud Internal Tools: A collection of internal tools (e.g. Prometheus) that you may find useful.
- Sentry: Our error tracking tool. Select `WATcloud Team` to get access to WATcloud projects.

As you get more involved in the team, you may need to access additional tools or upgrade your access level.
A team lead will help you with this.
